## Introduction

This project is a compilation of Java assignments aimed at practicing and improving problem-solving, algorithm design, and foundational programming skills. Each assignment highlights a specific area of programming, including searching, sorting, string manipulation, and logical operations, offering practical experience with Java fundamentals.

The tasks are thoughtfully designed to challenge beginner and intermediate-level programmers, equipping them with the skills needed for real-world problem-solving situations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the assignments, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**  
  - Version 8 or higher. For my case, I have used** JDK 17**
  - [Download JDK from Oracle's Official Website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).  

- **Java IDE**  
  - Any Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as:  
    - [**IntelliJ IDEA**](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)  
    - [**Eclipse**](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)  
    - [**NetBeans**](https://netbeans.apache.org/)
    - [**Visual Studio code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Problem Solving Highlights 

This project features solutions to various Java programming assignments, covering a wide range of topics:  

- **Search and Sorting Algorithms**: Identify the 2nd highest CGPA, implement binary search, and perform manual sorting.  
- **Random Number Operations**: Generate random numbers and determine minimum/maximum values.  
- **Pattern Printing**: Programmatically create complex output patterns.  
- **String Manipulations**: Count words, characters, vowels, and consonants; remove vowels from strings.  
- **Custom Algorithms**: Break down currency notes, validate IP addresses, and verify binary strings.  
- **HTML Parsing**: Extract transaction IDs using string operations.  
- **Password Generation**: Generate secure passwords following custom rules.  
- **Mathematical Operations**: Solve logical problems such as distributing question marks and calculating discounts.  

All solutions are implemented programmatically without built-in shortcuts (e.g., `Arrays.sort()`), fostering a deeper understanding of core algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
